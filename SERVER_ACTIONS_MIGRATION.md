## Implementation Plan

### âœ… Phase 1 Complete: Setup and Infrastructure

Successfully set up the foundation for TanStack Query integration and API client utilities.

### ðŸ”„ Current Focus: Phase 2 - Client Management Migration

Converting client management components from server actions to API hooks with proper error handling and loading states.

### Relevant Files

- `package.json` - Dependencies for TanStack Query âœ…
- `components/providers/query-provider.tsx` - React Query client provider âœ…
- `app/layout.tsx` - Root layout with QueryProvider âœ…
- `lib/api/client.ts` - API client utilities and error handling âœ…
- `hooks/api/use-clients.ts` - Client management API hooks
- `components/clients/` - Client management components to update

### Phase 1 Implementation Details

**Completed Infrastructure:**
- âœ… **TanStack Query**: Installed `@tanstack/react-query` and `@tanstack/react-query-devtools`
- âœ… **Query Provider**: Updated with optimized configuration including:
  - Smart retry logic (no retry on 4xx errors)
  - 5-minute stale time and 10-minute garbage collection
  - Enhanced error handling for mutations
- âœ… **Root Layout**: Already integrated QueryProvider wrapper
- âœ… **API Client**: Created comprehensive utilities with:
  - `ApiError` class for structured error handling
  - Type-safe `apiCall` function with proper error parsing
  - HTTP method helpers (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
  - Error checking utilities

**Ready for Phase 2:**
The foundation is now in place to begin migrating individual server actions to API hooks, starting with client management.

### Next Steps After Phase 2

1. **Phase 3**: Convert user management forms to API calls
2. **Phase 4**: Replace assessment server actions with API mutations
3. **Phase 5**: Update course progress tracking to use API endpoints
4. **Phase 6**: Convert file management to API-based operations
