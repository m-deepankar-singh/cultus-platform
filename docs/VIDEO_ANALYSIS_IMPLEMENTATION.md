## Future Tasks

- [ ] Add retry mechanism for failed Gemini uploads
- [ ] Implement progress tracking for video processing
- [ ] Add webhook support for analysis completion notifications
- [ ] Create admin interface to view analysis results
- [ ] Add batch processing for multiple video analyses
- [ ] Implement video compression before upload to reduce processing time
- [ ] Add analysis quality checks and validation
- [ ] Create analytics dashboard for interview performance trends

## Implementation Plan

### Two-Step Video Processing Architecture

1. **Step 1: Supabase Storage**
   - Video recorded in browser (webm format)
   - Uploaded directly to Supabase `interview_recordings` bucket
   - Submission record created in `job_readiness_ai_interview_submissions` table
   - Video URL and metadata stored in database

2. **Step 2: Gemini Analysis with Structured Outputs**
   - Background process downloads video from Supabase
   - Creates temporary file for Gemini Files API upload
   - Uploads to Gemini Files API with proper mime type
   - Waits for processing completion
   - Generates comprehensive structured analysis using defined schema
   - Cleans up temporary and Gemini files
   - Updates database with detailed analysis results and verdict

### Structured Analysis Schema

The enhanced analysis now provides:

#### Core Assessment Areas:
1. **Communication Skills** (clarity, pace, professional language)
2. **Technical Knowledge** (domain understanding, depth, accuracy)
3. **Problem Solving** (structured thinking, logical approach, creativity)
4. **Confidence & Presence** (body language, eye contact, overall confidence)
5. **Interview Engagement** (responsiveness, engagement level, listening skills)

#### Comprehensive Output:
- **Detailed Scoring**: Each area scored 1-10 with specific feedback
- **Areas for Improvement**: Prioritized actionable feedback
- **Strengths**: Identified positive aspects with evidence
- **Overall Assessment**: Total score, tier appropriateness, summary
- **Final Verdict**: APPROVED/REJECTED with reasoning and confidence level

#### Tier-Specific Thresholds:
- **BRONZE**: 60/100 minimum (basic competency)
- **SILVER**: 70/100 minimum (intermediate skills)
- **GOLD**: 80/100 minimum (advanced expertise)

### Data Flow

```
Browser Recording → Supabase Storage → Database Insert → Background Analysis Trigger
                                                                    ↓
Database Update ← Structured Analysis ← Video Processing ← Gemini Files Upload
       ↓
Final Verdict (APPROVED/REJECTED) + Detailed Scoring + Actionable Feedback
```
