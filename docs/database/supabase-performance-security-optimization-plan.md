# Supabase Performance and Security Optimization Plan

## Overview
This plan addresses critical performance and security issues identified by the Supabase advisor, including unindexed foreign keys, RLS policy optimization, and function security hardening.

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: This plan is for analysis and planning purposes only. Do NOT execute any SQL commands without proper testing and approval. All changes should be implemented in a staging environment first.

## Issues Identified by Supabase Advisor

### Performance Issues
- **Unindexed Foreign Keys**: 11 tables affected with foreign key constraints without covering indexes
- **Auth RLS Initialization Plan Issues**: RLS policies re-evaluating `auth.uid()` for each row
- **Missing Role Specifications**: Policies running for all users including `anon`

### Security Issues  
- **Function Search Path Issues**: Functions without proper `search_path` settings
- **RLS Enabled with No Policies**: Tables with RLS enabled but no access policies defined

## 1. RLS Policy Performance Optimization

### 1.1 Fix Auth Function Initialization Plan Issues
**Problem**: RLS policies re-evaluate `auth.uid()` for each row, causing severe performance issues.

**Solution**: Wrap auth functions in `select` statements to cache results per query.

#### Steps:
1. **Identify affected policies** - Review all RLS policies using `auth.uid()`, `auth.jwt()`, or `auth.role()`
2. **Update policies with select wrapping**:
   ```sql
   -- Instead of:
   CREATE POLICY "policy_name" ON table_name
   USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
   
   -- Use:
   CREATE POLICY "policy_name" ON table_name
   USING ((SELECT auth.uid()) = user_id);
   ```

3. **Test performance improvements** using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`
4. **Apply to all affected tables systematically**

**Expected Performance Improvement**: 94-99% query time reduction based on Supabase benchmarks.

### 1.2 Add Required Indexes for RLS Policies
**Problem**: Columns used in RLS policies lack proper indexes.

#### Steps:
1. **Create indexes on user_id columns** (most common RLS pattern):
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_table_name_user_id ON table_name USING btree (user_id);
   ```

2. **Index other columns used in policies** based on specific RLS conditions
3. **Prioritize high-traffic tables** first
4. **Monitor index usage** with `pg_stat_user_indexes`

**Expected Performance Improvement**: 99%+ query time reduction for indexed columns.

### 1.3 Specify Roles in Policies
**Problem**: Policies not specifying roles run for all users including `anon`.

#### Steps:
1. **Add `TO authenticated` clause** to all policies intended for logged-in users:
   ```sql
   CREATE POLICY "policy_name" ON table_name
   FOR SELECT
   TO authenticated
   USING ((SELECT auth.uid()) = user_id);
   ```

2. **Use `TO anon, authenticated`** only when both roles need access
3. **Review and update existing policies** systematically

**Expected Performance Improvement**: 99%+ for anon users by skipping policy execution.

## 2. Database Index Optimization

### 2.1 Add Missing Foreign Key Indexes
**Problem**: 11 tables have foreign key constraints without covering indexes.

#### Priority Tables (identified by advisor):
- `assessment_module_questions`
- `assessment_questions` 
- `assessment_submissions`
- `client_product_assignments`
- `job_readiness_ai_interview_submissions`
- `job_readiness_expert_session_progress`
- `student_module_progress`
- `interview_submissions`
- `project_submissions`
- `promotion_exam_submissions`
- Additional tables as identified

#### Implementation Steps:
1. **For each table with unindexed foreign keys**:
   ```sql
   -- Example for assessment_module_questions
   CREATE INDEX idx_assessment_module_questions_assessment_id 
   ON assessment_module_questions USING btree (assessment_id);
   
   CREATE INDEX idx_assessment_module_questions_question_id 
   ON assessment_module_questions USING btree (question_id);
   ```

2. **Use concurrent index creation** for large tables to avoid locks:
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_name ON table_name (column_name);
   ```

3. **Monitor index creation progress** and impact on database performance
4. **Verify index usage** after creation using query plans

### 2.2 Index Creation Strategy
1. **Start with highest traffic tables** based on query frequency
2. **Create indexes during low-traffic periods** if not using CONCURRENTLY
3. **Monitor disk space usage** as indexes require additional storage
4. **Test query performance** before and after index creation

## 3. Security Hardening

### 3.1 Fix Function Security Issues
**Problem**: Functions lack proper `search_path` settings, creating security vulnerabilities.

#### Steps:
1. **Identify all custom functions** without explicit search_path:
   ```sql
   SELECT 
     schemaname, 
     functionname, 
     definition 
   FROM pg_functions 
   WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
   AND definition NOT LIKE '%search_path%';
   ```

2. **Update function definitions** to include `SET search_path = ''`:
   ```sql
   CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION function_name()
   RETURNS return_type
   LANGUAGE plpgsql
   SET search_path = ''  -- Add this line
   AS $$
   BEGIN
     -- Ensure all references are schema-qualified (e.g., public.table_name)
     SELECT * FROM public.your_table;
   END;
   $$;
   ```

3. **Update function bodies** to use fully qualified names:
   - Change `table_name` to `public.table_name`
   - Change `auth.uid()` to `auth.uid()` (auth schema is still accessible)
   - Update all table, view, and function references

4. **Test all functions** to ensure they work with empty search_path

### 3.2 RLS Policy Security Review
**Problem**: Some tables have RLS enabled but no policies defined.

#### Steps:
1. **Identify tables with RLS enabled but no policies**:
   ```sql
   SELECT 
     schemaname, 
     tablename,
     rowsecurity 
   FROM pg_tables t
   JOIN pg_class c ON c.relname = t.tablename
   WHERE c.relrowsecurity = true
   AND NOT EXISTS (
     SELECT 1 FROM pg_policies p 
     WHERE p.schemaname = t.schemaname 
     AND p.tablename = t.tablename
   )
   AND schemaname = 'public';
   ```

2. **For each table, either**:
   - Create appropriate RLS policies based on business requirements
   - Or create explicit denial policy if no access should be allowed:
     ```sql
     CREATE POLICY "deny_all" ON table_name
     FOR ALL USING (false);
     ```
