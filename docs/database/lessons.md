## Usage Notes

- Lessons are the individual content units within course modules
- The `sequence` field determines the order in which lessons appear within a module
- Lessons can include embedded video content via the `video_url` field
- Lessons can optionally include a quiz (when `has_quiz` is true)
- For lessons with quizzes, the quiz data is stored directly in the `quiz_data` and `quiz_questions` JSONB fields
- Unlike assessments, lesson quizzes are typically simpler and stored directly with the lesson rather than in separate tables
