## Implementation Details

### Architecture

The promotion exams management feature follows the established patterns in the Job Readiness admin panel:

- **Table Components**: Use `@tanstack/react-table` with custom `JrDataTable` wrapper
- **Form Components**: Use `react-hook-form` with Zod validation
- **API Routes**: Follow RESTful patterns with proper admin authentication
- **State Management**: Use React hooks with proper error handling
- **UI Components**: Leverage shadcn/ui components with consistent styling

### Key Components

1. **JrPromotionExamConfigTable**
   - Displays exam configurations with product relationships
   - Shows status, question count, pass threshold, time limits
   - Provides edit/delete actions with confirmation dialogs

2. **JrPromotionExamConfigForm**
   - Modal form for creating/editing exam configurations
   - Product selection dropdown (disabled when editing)
   - Validation for all numeric fields and constraints
   - Toggle for enabling/disabling exams

3. **JrPromotionExamAttemptsTable**
   - Displays student exam attempts with status badges
   - Shows student info, scores, time taken, completion status
   - Provides view details action for future implementation

4. **JrPromotionExamStats**
   - Statistical overview cards showing key metrics
   - Pass rate, average score, average time calculations
   - Color-coded indicators based on performance thresholds

5. **JrPromotionExamStatusBreakdown**
   - Compact status badges for quick overview
   - Shows counts for passed, failed, in-progress, abandoned attempts

### API Endpoints

- `GET /api/admin/job-readiness/promotion-exams` - Fetch exam configurations
- `POST /api/admin/job-readiness/promotion-exams` - Create exam configuration
- `PATCH /api/admin/job-readiness/promotion-exams` - Update exam configuration
- `DELETE /api/admin/job-readiness/promotion-exams` - Delete exam configuration
- `GET /api/admin/job-readiness/promotion-exam-attempts` - Fetch exam attempts (with filtering)

### Database Schema

The implementation assumes the following database tables:
- `job_readiness_promotion_exam_config` - Exam configuration settings
- `job_readiness_promotion_exam_attempts` - Student exam attempts
- `products` - Job Readiness products
- `profiles` - User profiles with student information

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test exam configuration creation with all field types
- [ ] Test exam configuration editing and validation
- [ ] Test exam configuration deletion with confirmation
- [ ] Test exam attempts table with various statuses

## Notes

- The implementation follows the existing Job Readiness admin panel patterns
- All components are fully typed with TypeScript
- Error handling and loading states are implemented throughout
- The design is responsive and follows the established UI patterns
- Form validation prevents invalid configurations
- The statistics provide meaningful insights for administrators
