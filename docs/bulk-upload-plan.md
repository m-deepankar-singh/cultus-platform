# Bulk Learner Upload Feature Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the tasks required to implement a bulk learner upload feature in the admin panel. This feature will allow administrators and staff to upload multiple learner records simultaneously using an Excel (.xlsx) file. The system will provide a downloadable template, allow users to review uploaded data before final submission, and ensure data validation.

## 1. Project Setup
- [ ] **Environment Configuration:**
  - [ ] Ensure the `xlsx` package (or a suitable equivalent for Excel parsing, e.g., `SheetJS/xlsx`) is added as a dependency to the backend.
  - [ ] Verify that environment variables for database connections and any relevant services are correctly configured for development, staging, and production.
- [ ] **Project Scaffolding (if necessary):**
  - [ ] Create necessary directory structures for new backend modules/services and frontend components if they don't already fit into the existing structure.

## 2. Backend Foundation
- [ ] **Authentication & Authorization:**
  - [ ] Review existing authentication middleware to ensure it can be applied to the new bulk upload endpoints.
  - [ ] Define or confirm roles/permissions: Ensure "admin" and "staff" roles have distinct permissions that can be checked for accessing this feature.
  - [ ] Implement a reusable authorization check mechanism for the new endpoints, restricting access to admin and staff users.
- [ ] **Core Services & Utilities:**
  - [ ] Develop or identify a utility for generating the sample Excel template file.
    - The template should clearly indicate mandatory fields (e.g., First Name, Last Name, Email, Client ID (if applicable), etc. *Note: Final list of mandatory fields to be confirmed based on the `learners` table schema and business requirements.*).
  - [ ] Set up a robust error handling and logging mechanism for the bulk upload process.

## 3. Feature-specific Backend
- [ ] **API Endpoint for Sample Excel Template Download:**
  - [ ] Create a `GET` API endpoint (e.g., `/api/admin/learners/bulk-upload-template`).
  - [ ] Implement logic to generate and return an `.xlsx` file as a downloadable template.
  - [ ] Ensure the endpoint is protected and accessible only by admin and staff.
- [ ] **API Endpoint for Excel File Upload and Parsing (Preview):**
  - [ ] Create a `POST` API endpoint (e.g., `/api/admin/learners/bulk-upload/parse-preview`).
  - [ ] Implement logic to receive an `.xlsx` file.
  - [ ] Use the `xlsx` library to parse the uploaded file.
  - [ ] Validate the file structure (e.g., expected sheet name, header row).
  - [ ] Perform initial validation on each row's data (e.g., presence of mandatory fields, basic data type checks).
  - [ ] Return a JSON response containing the parsed data (or a significant preview sample if data is very large) and any validation errors per row. This data will be used for the frontend review table.
  - [ ] Ensure this endpoint is protected and accessible only by admin and staff.
- [ ] **API Endpoint for Final Learner Data Submission:**
  - [ ] Create a `POST` API endpoint (e.g., `/api/admin/learners/bulk-upload/submit`).
  - [ ] Implement logic to receive the reviewed (and potentially corrected by resubmission if initial parse had errors) learner data, likely in JSON format matching the preview structure.
  - [ ] Perform comprehensive data validation for each learner record:
    - Check for mandatory fields.
    - Validate data types and formats (e.g., email format).
    - Check for duplicates (e.g., existing email if emails must be unique).
    - Validate against any business rules (e.g., valid Client ID if learners are associated with clients).
  - [ ] For each valid learner record, create a new entry in the `learners` database table.
  - [ ] Implement transaction management to ensure atomicity (either all valid learners are added, or none are if a critical error occurs during batch processing).
  - [ ] Return a detailed success/failure response, including:
    - Count of successfully uploaded learners.
    - List of any learners that failed to upload, along with specific error messages for each.
  - [ ] Ensure this endpoint is protected and accessible only by admin and staff.
- [ ] **Database Schema:**
  - [ ] Review the `learners` table schema. Confirm all mandatory fields for bulk upload are present. If new fields are needed, plan and execute a database migration.

## 4. Frontend Foundation
- [ ] **UI Framework & Components:**
  - [ ] Ensure a modal component is available and customizable for this feature.
  - [ ] Verify a table component is available for displaying the preview data, capable of handling potential pagination or scrolling for large datasets.
  - [ ] Ensure UI elements for file input and buttons are consistent with the existing design system.
- [ ] **State Management:**
  - [ ] Plan the state management strategy for the bulk upload modal (e.g., file object, parsed data, validation errors, loading states, API responses). Consider using existing state management solutions (e.g., Zustand, Redux, React Context).

## 5. Feature-specific Frontend
- [ ] **"Bulk Upload" Button/Link:**
  - [ ] Add a "Bulk Upload Learners" button or link in the learners tab of the admin panel UI (`app/(dashboard)/admin/users/page.tsx` or a similar learners management page).
  - [ ] Ensure this button is only visible/enabled for users with admin or staff roles.
- [ ] **Bulk Upload Modal:**
  - [ ] Develop the modal component that appears when the "Bulk Upload" button is clicked.
  - [ ] **File Upload Section:**
    - [ ] Implement a file input element restricted to `.xlsx` files.
    - [ ] Add a clear "Download Sample Excel Template" link/button that triggers a call to the `/api/admin/learners/bulk-upload-template` endpoint.
  - [ ] **Data Preview Section:**
    - [ ] Upon successful file selection and client-side validation (e.g. file type, size), trigger a call to the `/api/admin/learners/bulk-upload/parse-preview` endpoint.
    - [ ] Display a loading indicator while the file is being processed.
    - [ ] On response, render the parsed learner data in a table within the modal for user review.
    - [ ] Clearly indicate any validation errors returned from the backend alongside the respective rows or as a summary.
  - [ ] **Action Buttons:**
    - [ ] Implement an "Upload Learners" button (or similar, e.g., "Submit", "Import") within the modal. This button should be enabled only after data has been successfully parsed and is ready for review/submission.
    - [ ] Implement a "Cancel" or "Close" button for the modal.
- [ ] **User Interaction & Feedback:**
  - [ ] Handle file selection and display the selected file name.
  - [ ] On clicking "Upload Learners", send the (potentially validated or client-confirmed) data to the `/api/admin/learners/bulk-upload/submit` endpoint.
  - [ ] Display a loading indicator during the final submission process.
  - [ ] Provide clear success messages (e.g., "X learners uploaded successfully").
  - [ ] Display detailed error messages if the submission fails or if some learners could not be imported, guiding the user on how to rectify issues (e.g., "Row 5: Email format invalid. Row 12: Duplicate email.").
  - [ ] Ensure the modal state resets correctly after completion or cancellation.
- [ ] **Client-Side Validation (Optional but Recommended):**
  - [ ] Implement basic client-side validation for the uploaded file (e.g., file type `.xlsx`, reasonable file size limit) before sending to the backend.

## 6. Integration
- [ ] **Frontend-Backend Connection:**
  - [ ] Connect the "Download Sample Template" link to the backend API endpoint.
  - [ ] Integrate the file input with the backend API for parsing and preview.
  - [ ] Connect the "Upload Learners" button in the modal to the final backend submission API.
- [ ] **Data Flow:**
  - [ ] Ensure seamless data flow: File -> Frontend -> Backend (Parse/Preview) -> Frontend (Review) -> Backend (Submit) -> Database.
- [ ] **Error Propagation:**
  - [ ] Ensure errors from the backend (validation, processing, database) are correctly propagated and displayed to the user on the frontend.

## 7. Testing
- [ ] **Backend Unit Tests:**
  - [ ] Test the Excel parsing logic with valid and invalid file structures/data.
  - [ ] Test data validation rules for individual learner records.
  - [ ] Test database interaction logic (learner creation).
  - [ ] Test sample template generation.
  - [ ] Test authorization logic for each endpoint.
- [ ] **Backend Integration Tests:**
  - [ ] Test the full flow for each API endpoint (request -> processing -> response).
  - [ ] Test with various scenarios: successful upload, partial success, complete failure due to validation errors.
  - [ ] Test database transaction handling.
- [ ] **Frontend Component Tests:**
  - [ ] Test the bulk upload modal component in isolation.
  - [ ] Test the file input, preview table, and action buttons.
- [ ] **Frontend Integration Tests:**
  - [ ] Test the interaction between different UI components in the bulk upload flow.
  - [ ] Test state management logic.
- [ ] **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:**
  - [ ] **Scenario 1 (Happy Path):** Admin/Staff logs in -> Navigates to learners tab -> Clicks "Bulk Upload" -> Downloads sample template -> Fills template with valid data -> Uploads Excel -> Reviews data -> Submits -> Verifies success message and new learners in the system.
  - [ ] **Scenario 2 (Invalid File Format):** User attempts to upload a non-`.xlsx` file.
  - [ ] **Scenario 3 (Data Validation Errors):** User uploads an `.xlsx` file with invalid data (missing mandatory fields, incorrect formats, duplicate entries). Verify errors are shown correctly in the review stage and/or after submission attempt.
  - [ ] **Scenario 4 (Authorization):** Non-admin/staff user attempts to access the feature or call the APIs directly; verify access is denied.
  - [ ] **Scenario 5 (Large File):** Test with a reasonably large Excel file to check performance (define acceptable limits).
- [ ] **Security Testing:**
  - [ ] Review for potential vulnerabilities (e.g., file upload vulnerabilities, insecure direct object references if applicable).
  - [ ] Ensure proper input sanitization.
