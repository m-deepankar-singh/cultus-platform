# Job Readiness: Student App Frontend Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the detailed step-by-step plan for implementing the student-facing frontend for the Job Readiness product. It includes UI components, page structures, API interactions, and state management considerations. The primary goal is to create an engaging and intuitive experience for students as they progress through the Job Readiness program.

### Business Rules
- **One Job Readiness Product per Client**: Each client can have multiple products (learning, assessment, etc.) but only ONE Job Readiness product. This is enforced at the database level.
- **Students inherit their client's single Job Readiness product**: No need for product selection - students automatically get their client's Job Readiness product.
- **Simplified API responses**: Since there's only one Job Readiness product per client, APIs return a single product rather than arrays.

## 9. General UI Elements & Considerations

- [ ] **Error Handling:**
  - Consistent error messages for API failures, locked modules, etc.
  - Retry mechanisms where appropriate.
- [ ] **Loading States:**
  - Skeletons or loaders for data fetching.
- [ ] **Instructions & Tooltips:**
  - Clear instructions for all AI-powered components and complex interactions.
- [ ] **Responsiveness:**
  - Ensure all new components and pages are responsive for mobile and desktop.
- [ ] **Accessibility (a11y):**
  - Adhere to accessibility best practices (semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation).
- [ ] **State Synchronization (TanStack Query):**
  - Use TanStack Query's invalidation and refetching mechanisms to ensure data consistency.
  - Invalidate relevant queries after significant actions (module completion, promotion exam, tier upgrades).
  - Implement optimistic updates where appropriate for better UX.
  - Use query keys strategically for efficient cache management and selective invalidation.

## 10. TanStack Query Implementation Details

- [ ] **Query Keys Strategy:**
  - [ ] Define consistent query key patterns:
    - `['job-readiness', 'products', productId]` for product data
    - `['job-readiness', 'progress', studentId]` for progress data
    - `['job-readiness', 'courses', moduleId]` for course content
    - `['job-readiness', 'expert-sessions', productId]` for expert sessions
    - `['job-readiness', 'interviews', 'questions']` for interview questions
- [ ] **Cache Configuration:**
  - [ ] Set appropriate `staleTime` and `cacheTime` for different data types:
    - Progress data: Shorter stale time (1-2 minutes) for real-time updates
    - Course content: Longer stale time (10-15 minutes) for static content
    - Expert sessions: Medium stale time (5 minutes) for semi-static content
- [ ] **Query Invalidation Patterns:**
  - [ ] Invalidate progress queries after module completion
  - [ ] Invalidate course queries after quiz submission
  - [ ] Invalidate expert session queries after watch progress updates
  - [ ] Use selective invalidation with specific query keys to avoid unnecessary refetches
- [ ] **Optimistic Updates:**
  - [ ] Implement optimistic updates for progress tracking (video progress, quiz attempts)
  - [ ] Implement rollback mechanisms for failed mutations
- [ ] **Error Handling:**
  - [ ] Create consistent error handling patterns for all Job Readiness queries
  - [ ] Implement retry logic for transient failures
  - [ ] Show appropriate error states in UI components

This plan provides a structured approach to developing the Job Readiness student frontend. Each section should be broken down further into smaller tasks during development sprints.
