# Migration Plan: SMTP to Resend API (Vercel Deployment)

## Overview
Migrate from current Nodemailer SMTP setup to Resend API while preserving temporary password email functionality. This plan is optimized for Vercel deployment infrastructure.

## Phase 1: Setup & Configuration (Est: 2-3 hours)
1. **Install Resend dependency**: Add `resend` package to package.json
2. **Environment variables**: Add `RESEND_API_KEY` to Vercel environment variables
3. **Create .env template**: Create `.env.local.template` for local development
4. **Backup existing service**: Create backup of current `lib/email/service.ts`

## Phase 2: Core Service Migration (Est: 4-6 hours)
1. **Create new Resend service**: Build `lib/email/resend-service.ts` with Resend client
2. **Migrate email interfaces**: Update `MailOptions` interface for Resend compatibility
3. **Implement base send function**: Replace SMTP transport with Resend API calls
4. **Add error handling**: Implement Resend-specific error handling and logging
5. **Remove SMTP verification**: Replace with Resend API key validation

## Phase 3: Template & Feature Migration (Est: 3-4 hours)
1. **Migrate welcome email**: Port `sendLearnerWelcomeEmail` to use Resend
2. **Preserve password functionality**: Maintain temporary password email feature (as requested)
3. **Template optimization**: Improve HTML/text templates with Resend best practices
4. **Response handling**: Update return values to match Resend API responses

## Phase 4: Integration Updates (Est: 2-3 hours)
1. **Update API routes**: Modify `app/api/admin/learners/route.ts` to use new service
2. **Update bulk upload**: Modify `app/api/admin/learners/bulk-upload/route.ts`
3. **Test integration**: Verify non-blocking behavior is maintained
4. **Update logging**: Enhance logging for Resend API responses

## Phase 5: Testing & Validation (Est: 3-4 hours)
1. **Create test suite**: Build comprehensive tests for Resend integration
2. **Update existing tests**: Modify test files to work with Resend API
3. **Local testing**: Test with Vercel dev environment
4. **Performance benchmarking**: Compare performance vs. current SMTP setup

## Phase 6: Deployment & Cleanup (Est: 2-3 hours)
1. **Vercel environment setup**: Configure RESEND_API_KEY in Vercel dashboard
2. **Deploy to staging**: Test in Vercel staging environment
3. **Update documentation**: Create Resend setup documentation
4. **Remove old dependencies**: Clean up Nodemailer dependencies
5. **Archive old service**: Move old SMTP service to archive folder

## Vercel-Specific Considerations
- **Environment Variables**: Use Vercel dashboard to set `RESEND_API_KEY`
- **Function Limits**: Resend API calls are more efficient than SMTP connections
- **Edge Runtime**: Resend is compatible with Vercel Edge Runtime if needed
- **Deployment**: No special configuration needed for Resend on Vercel
- **Monitoring**: Leverage Vercel's built-in monitoring for API calls

## Key Preservation Requirements
- **Temporary password emails**: Maintain exact same functionality for sending passwords
- **Non-blocking behavior**: Ensure API operations don't fail if email fails
- **Template content**: Preserve existing welcome email content and styling
- **Error handling**: Maintain graceful degradation patterns

## Environment Configuration
**Current (SMTP)**:
- `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS`, `SMTP_SECURE`, `EMAIL_FROM`

**New (Resend)**:
- `RESEND_API_KEY` (only variable needed)
- `EMAIL_FROM` (reuse existing)

## Benefits of Migration
- **Better deliverability**: Resend provides superior email delivery rates
- **Improved performance**: API-based sending vs. SMTP connection overhead
- **Enhanced reliability**: Built-in retry mechanisms and better error handling
- **Vercel optimization**: Native support for serverless functions
- **Scalability**: No SMTP connection limits or timeout issues

## Risk Mitigation
- **Gradual rollout**: Test thoroughly in Vercel staging before production
- **Fallback option**: Keep old SMTP service as backup during transition
- **Monitoring**: Enhanced logging to catch any delivery issues
- **Environment testing**: Test in both local and Vercel environments

## Files to be Created/Modified
- `lib/email/resend-service.ts` (new)
- `lib/email/service.ts` (backup/archive)
- `package.json` (add resend dependency)
- `.env.local.template` (new - for local development)
- `app/api/admin/learners/route.ts` (import update)
- `app/api/admin/learners/bulk-upload/route.ts` (import update)
- `docs/resend-migration-plan.md` (this document)
- Test files (update for Resend)

## Deployment Steps
1. **Local Development**: Test with `.env.local` file
2. **Vercel Staging**: Deploy with RESEND_API_KEY environment variable
3. **Production**: Deploy to production after staging validation

**Total Estimated Time**: 16-23 hours
**Recommended Timeline**: 3-4 working days
