# Assessment Tier Assignment After All Modules Complete - Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the detailed step-by-step plan to modify the Job Readiness assessment system so that tiers are only calculated and assigned when ALL assessment modules for a product are completed. Until then, students should see "No Tier" status.

## Current Implementation Analysis

### Current Behavior
- Tiers are assigned immediately after completing the first assessment module
- Each individual assessment determines its own tier based on its score
- The `TierDisplay` component shows tier information even with partial completion
- The assessment submission API awards tiers on a per-module basis

### Current Code Locations
1. **Assessment Submission API**: `app/api/app/job-readiness/assessments/[moduleId]/submit/route.ts`
   - Contains tier calculation logic (lines 270-290)
   - Awards tiers immediately after submission
   - Recently updated to check all assessments for star unlock (lines 330-420)

2. **TierDisplay Component**: `components/job-readiness/TierDisplay.tsx`
   - Shows current tier information
   - Displays tier criteria and current status

3. **Progress Hooks**: 
   - `hooks/useJobReadinessProgress.ts`: Fetches overall progress
   - `hooks/useAssessmentList.ts`: Fetches assessment-specific data

4. **Assessment List Component**: `components/job-readiness/AssessmentList.tsx`
   - Displays assessment cards with tier information

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Backend API Changes

## Implementation Order

### Sprint 1: Core Backend Changes
1. Modify assessment submission API (1.1)
2. Update assessment list API (1.2)
3. Test API changes thoroughly

### Sprint 2: Frontend Component Updates
1. Update TierDisplay component (2.1)
2. Update AssessmentList component (2.2)
3. Update AssessmentCard component (2.3)

### Sprint 3: Hook Updates & Polish
1. Update hooks (3.1, 3.2)
2. Create new components (4.1)
3. Update results pages (4.2)

### Sprint 4: Testing & Validation
1. Comprehensive testing (6.1, 6.2, 6.3)
2. Documentation updates (7.1, 7.2)
3. Data migration if needed (5.1, 5.2)

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Tier Calculation Method
**Decision**: Calculate tier based on average score across all assessment modules
**Rationale**: Provides fair overall assessment of student capabilities

### 2. Partial Assessment State
**Decision**: Show "No Tier" instead of defaulting to Bronze
**Rationale**: More accurate representation of incomplete assessment state

### 3. Tier Assignment Timing
**Decision**: Only assign tier when ALL assessments complete
**Rationale**: Ensures comprehensive evaluation before tier determination

### 4. Backward Compatibility
**Decision**: Review existing tier assignments case-by-case
**Rationale**: May need to preserve valid existing tiers vs reset incomplete ones

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Students see "No Tier" until ALL assessments are completed
- [ ] Tier calculation occurs only after all assessment modules are finished
- [ ] Tier is based on overall performance across all assessments
- [ ] UI clearly communicates the tier assignment process
- [ ] All existing functionality continues to work
- [ ] No regression in assessment submission flow
- [ ] Clear progress indicators for tier determination

## Risk Mitigation

### 1. Breaking Changes
**Risk**: Changes could break existing flows
**Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing, gradual rollout

### 2. User Confusion
**Risk**: Users may not understand new tier assignment process
**Mitigation**: Clear messaging, help text, progress indicators

### 3. Data Consistency
**Risk**: Existing tier data may be inconsistent with new logic
**Mitigation**: Data analysis, migration script if needed

### 4. Performance Impact
**Risk**: Additional queries for "all assessments complete" check
**Mitigation**: Optimize queries, add appropriate indexes
