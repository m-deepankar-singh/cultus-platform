1. **Assessment Creation**: Admin creates assessment via modules system
2. **Student Access**: Students access via module-based endpoints
3. **Progress Tracking**: All progress saved to `student_module_progress`
4. **Tier Progression**: Automatic tier updates based on scores
5. **Star Unlocking**: Star level progression on tier achievements
