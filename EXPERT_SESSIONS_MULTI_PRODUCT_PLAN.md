## Overview
This document outlines the plan to refactor the Expert Sessions feature to allow a single expert session to be assigned to multiple Job Readiness products. This changes the existing one-to-one relationship (one session to one product) to a many-to-many relationship, improving content reuse and administrative efficiency.

**Current Database Structure Analysis:**
- `job_readiness_expert_sessions` table currently has a direct `product_id` foreign key to `products` table
- Video storage path is currently: `products/{productId}/expert-sessions/{uniqueFileName}`
- Progress tracking is done via `job_readiness_expert_session_progress` table

## 1. Database Schema Changes âœ… **COMPLETED**
The core of this change is to model the many-to-many relationship between expert sessions and products.

- [x] **Create a Junction Table** âœ…
  - âœ… Created `job_readiness_expert_session_products` table with proper schema
  - âœ… Added composite primary key and foreign key constraints
  - âœ… Enabled CASCADE delete for data integrity
  - **Schema:**
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE job_readiness_expert_session_products (
      expert_session_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES job_readiness_expert_sessions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
      product_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES products(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
      created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
      PRIMARY KEY (expert_session_id, product_id)
    );
    
    -- Create indexes for efficient querying
    CREATE INDEX idx_expert_session_products_session_id ON job_readiness_expert_session_products(expert_session_id);
    CREATE INDEX idx_expert_session_products_product_id ON job_readiness_expert_session_products(product_id);
    ```

- [x] **Data Migration Script** âœ…
  - âœ… Successfully migrated all 8 existing expert sessions to junction table
  - âœ… All existing product associations preserved (100% data integrity)
  - âœ… Tested multi-product functionality - working correctly
  - **Migration Results:** 8 sessions â†’ 9 total associations (1 session tested with multiple products)

- [x] **Update Video Storage Strategy** âœ… (Planned)
  - **Current Path:** `products/{productId}/expert-sessions/{uniqueFileName}`
  - **New Path:** `expert-sessions/{sessionId}/{uniqueFileName}` 
  - This eliminates the dependency on a single product ID for storage
  - Existing videos can remain in their current paths (no migration needed)
  - New videos will use the session-based path

- [ ] **Alter `job_readiness_expert_sessions` Table** (Phase 4 - Cleanup)
  - After successful data migration and API updates, remove the `product_id` column from the `job_readiness_expert_sessions` table.
  - This step should be done after the API is updated to use the new junction table to avoid breaking the application.

## 2. Upload Helper Function Updates âœ… **COMPLETED**
The video upload functionality needs to be updated to support the new storage strategy.

- [x] **Create New Upload Function** âœ…
  - âœ… Created `uploadExpertSessionVideoById(file: File, sessionId: string)` in `lib/supabase/upload-helpers.ts`
  - âœ… Uses path: `expert-sessions/{sessionId}/{uniqueFileName}` instead of `products/{productId}/expert-sessions/{uniqueFileName}`
  - âœ… Kept the existing `uploadExpertSessionVideo` function with @deprecated tag for backwards compatibility

- [x] **Update File Path Logic** âœ…
  - âœ… New storage bucket structure: `expert-session-videos-public/expert-sessions/{sessionId}/`
  - âœ… Eliminates the product dependency in the file path
  - âœ… Existing videos remain accessible at their current paths

## 3. Backend API Refactoring âœ… **COMPLETED**
The API endpoints have been updated to handle the new many-to-many relationship.

- [x] **Update `GET` Endpoint** âœ…
  - âœ… Updated query to fetch expert sessions through junction table with associated products
  - âœ… Response transformation to group products by session implemented
  - âœ… Product filtering works with many-to-many relationship
  - âœ… Completion statistics calculation updated for new data structure
  - **Query uses junction table with proper product filtering and response transformation**

- [x] **Update `POST` Endpoint** âœ…
  - âœ… Modified to accept `product_ids` array instead of single `product_id`
  - âœ… Updated to use new session-based video upload (`uploadExpertSessionVideoById`)
  - âœ… Implemented transaction-like error handling with proper cleanup
  - âœ… Creates session first, uploads video, then creates product associations
  - âœ… Full rollback on any failure (removes session and uploaded file)
  - **Process:** Session creation â†’ Video upload â†’ URL update â†’ Product associations

- [x] **Update `PATCH` Endpoint** âœ…
  - âœ… Modified to accept `product_ids` array for updating product assignments
  - âœ… Implemented differential update logic (calculates add/remove operations)
  - âœ… Maintains existing functionality for title, description, is_active updates
  - âœ… Returns session with updated product associations
  - **Logic:** Validate products â†’ Calculate differences â†’ Remove old â†’ Add new â†’ Return updated

- [x] **Update `DELETE` Endpoint** âœ…
  - âœ… No changes required - soft delete functionality works correctly
  - âœ… CASCADE delete ensures junction table cleanup if hard delete is implemented
  - âœ… Existing implementation is compatible with new schema

## 4. Frontend UI/UX Enhancements (Admin Dashboard)
The admin interface for managing expert sessions needs to be updated.

- [ ] **Create/Edit Expert Session Form**
  - Replace the single product dropdown with a multi-select component (e.g., a multi-select dropdown with search, or a list of checkboxes).
  - This component will allow admins to select one or more Job Readiness products to associate with the session.
  - The form's state management needs to handle an array of `product_ids`.

- [ ] **Expert Session List/Table**
  - In the table view of expert sessions, update the "Product" column to display the list of assigned products for each session. This could be a list of product names or tags.
  - The product filter should still work as expected, filtering sessions based on the new many-to-many relationship.

## 5. Frontend Changes (Student-Facing App)
The student-facing part of the application needs to be updated to correctly display expert sessions.

- [ ] **Update Expert Session Display Logic**
  - Any page or component that fetches expert sessions for a specific product (e.g., on a product's dashboard) must be updated.
  - The API calls from the client should fetch expert sessions associated with the current product context, using the updated backend logic.
  - **Check and Update Student-Facing API Endpoints:**
    - Look for `/api/app/job-readiness/expert-sessions` or similar endpoints
    - Ensure they use the new many-to-many relationship for filtering
    - Update response handling to work with the new data structure

- [ ] **Update Progress Tracking**
  - The `job_readiness_expert_session_progress` table structure remains the same
  - No changes needed for progress tracking as it's already session-specific, not product-specific

## 6. Testing
- [ ] **Backend Unit/Integration Tests**
  - Write tests for the updated API endpoints (`GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`).
  - Test edge cases:
    - Creating a session with no products.
    - Assigning a session to one, and then multiple products.
    - Updating a session to have zero products.
    - Deleting a session and ensuring it's no longer accessible.

- [ ] **Frontend Tests**
  - Test the new multi-select component in the admin form.
  - Test the updated session list to ensure it correctly displays multiple products and filtering works.
  - Test the student-facing view to ensure the correct sessions appear for a given product.

- [ ] **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**
  - Create an E2E test that covers:
    1. Admin creates a new expert session and assigns it to 2 products.
    2. Admin edits the session to assign it to 3 products.
    3. Verify a student in one of those products can see the session.
    4. Verify a student in a product not assigned to the session cannot see it.
    5. Admin deletes the session.
    6. Verify no students can see the session anymore.

## 8. Technical Considerations & Challenges

- [ ] **Data Consistency**
  - Ensure atomic operations when creating sessions with multiple product associations
  - Handle edge cases where a session is assigned to zero products
  - Consider adding validation to prevent duplicate associations

- [ ] **Performance Implications**
  - The junction table will increase query complexity
  - Monitor query performance, especially for large numbers of sessions/products
  - Consider adding database query optimization if needed

- [ ] **Storage Migration Strategy**
  - Existing videos remain at `products/{productId}/expert-sessions/` paths
  - New videos use `expert-sessions/{sessionId}/` paths
  - No immediate migration needed, but consider future cleanup

- [ ] **Backwards Compatibility**
  - Keep both storage path strategies during transition
  - Maintain old API structure temporarily if needed for gradual migration
  - Plan deprecation timeline for old single-product approach

## 9. Documentation
- [ ] **Update API Documentation**
  - Update any existing API documentation (e.g., Swagger, Postman collections) to reflect the changes in request/response payloads for the expert sessions API.
  - Specifically document the change from `product_id` to `product_ids`.
  - Document the new response structure with product arrays instead of single product objects.
- [ ] **Database Schema Documentation**
  - Update ER diagrams to show the new many-to-many relationship
  - Document the junction table structure and indexes
  - Add migration scripts to documentation
