## Implementation Plan

The AI services integrate with the Gemini API to provide AI-powered features for the Job Readiness product. Each service is implemented as a separate module in the `lib/ai/` directory with corresponding API routes.

### Relevant Files

- ✅ `lib/ai/gemini-client.ts` - Client for making calls to the Google Gemini API
- ✅ `lib/ai/quiz-generator.ts` - Generates quizzes from video content or topics
- ✅ `lib/ai/project-generator.ts` - Generates real-world project descriptions
- ✅ `lib/ai/project-grader.ts` - Grades submitted projects with detailed feedback
- ⏳ `lib/ai/interview-question-generator.js` - Generates interview questions
- ⏳ `lib/ai/video-analyzer.js` - Analyzes recorded interview videos
- ⏳ `lib/ai/exam-generator.js` - Generates promotion exam questions

### API Routes
- ✅ `app/api/app/job-readiness/courses/[moduleId]/content/route.ts` - Uses quiz generator
- ✅ `app/api/app/job-readiness/courses/[moduleId]/lessons/[lessonId]/submit-quiz/route.ts` - Uses quiz generator
- ✅ `app/api/app/job-readiness/projects/generate/route.ts` - Uses project generator (now generates new projects on each refresh)
- ✅ `app/api/app/job-readiness/projects/submit/route.ts` - Uses project grader with structured feedback
- ⏳ `app/api/app/job-readiness/interviews/questions/route.ts` - Will use interview question generator
- ⏳ `app/api/app/job-readiness/interviews/submit/route.ts` - Will use video analyzer
- ⏳ `app/api/app/job-readiness/promotion-exam/start/route.ts` - Will use exam generator

### Project Generation Behavior
- Projects are generated dynamically on each request
- A new project is shown each time the student refreshes the page
- When the student submits an answer, both the project details and the answer are saved in the database
- After submission, no new projects are generated for that student/product combination

### Project Grading Behavior
- Project submissions are evaluated by AI using Gemini API with structured outputs
- Feedback includes an overall summary, specific strengths, weaknesses, and improvement suggestions
- Students must score 80 or higher to pass the project
- Students at star level 3 who pass the project are automatically promoted to star level 4
